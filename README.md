# Classification-algorithms-in-machine-learning
This project is a overview for how to implement the classification algorithm to the data set. 

Classification algorithm will be choosen, when target variable is available.
It is used to predict future values from binary value 1 and 0.

In this project we are using heart.csv to predict whether the particular person suffer heart disease or not. 

FEATURE SCALING:
In this project we are scaling values before it has to be trained by the model. 
Here we are using standar scaler. 

CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS:
The classification algorithms used are:

1) Logistic regression

2) KNeighboursClassifier

3) SVC

4) Naive bayes

5) DecisionTreeClassifiers

6) RandomForestClassifier

7) XGBClassifier

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
Also analysis have been performed to predict which feature have been playing a key role for heart attack detection
